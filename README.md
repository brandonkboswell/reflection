# Reflection
When this plugin is enabled it will show any daily or weekly notes associated with the opened day. For example if you have a note from 2023-07-01 it will show you notes from 2022-07-01 as well as previous years. While lookling at weekly notes it will show you weekly notes from previous years with the same week number.
