# Reflection
When this plugin is enabled, it will show past daily or weekly notes from the associated daily/weekly note. For example, if you have a daily note from 2023-07-01 it will show you the daily note from 2022-07-01 as well as previous years (if there are any). While lookling at weekly notes, it will show you weekly notes from previous years with the same week number.
